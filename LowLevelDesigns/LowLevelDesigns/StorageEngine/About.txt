Let's walk through a very basic key-value storage engine similar to in concept to HaloDb.

What is HaloDb?
HaloDb is a persistent key-value store inspired by Bitcask, optimized for high throughput and low latency.
Its main concept:
1. Append-only log files: Writes go to a log file(like a WAL - write - ahead log).
2. In-memory index: A hash map in memory pointing keys to their offset in the log file.
3. Compaction: Periodically reqrites active keys into new log files and avoid file bloat.

(Persistent in a database or storage engine means: The data you write is not lost when the program stops or the machine shuts down. It survives crashes, reboots or restarts).


Phase 1 Commit:
Functions:
1. Write (key,value) to log file where the key is mapped to an offset in the file where the (key,value) are stored.
2. Read data from log file
3. Rebuild index
4. Maintain a hash-map in memory with key:offset pairs
