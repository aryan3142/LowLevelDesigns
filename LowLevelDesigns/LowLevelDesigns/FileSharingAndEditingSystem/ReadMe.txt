Questions: Design a file sharing system like Google-Docs that allows real-time collaborative document editing and file-sharing.
The core challenges include:

a. Concurrent Updates handling
b. Conflict Resolution (via Operational Transformation or Conflict-free replicated data types - CDRTs)
c. Efficient File sharing and Access Control
d. Real-time synhcronization with low latency

Notes:

WHen a client wants to establish a WebSocket connection, it first sends an HTTP request with a special "Upgrade" header. This tells the server
that the client wants to switch HTTP to WebSocket The server acknowledges this request and switches protocols.

1️. Initial HTTP Request from Client
The WebSocket always starts as an HTTP request (typically GET):

GET /api/collab/ws/{documentId} HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Key Headers Explained:

Upgrade: websocket → Tells the server the client wants to upgrade to WebSockets.

Connection: Upgrade → Ensures the connection switch.

Sec-WebSocket-Key → A random key generated by the client (used for security).

Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13 → Specifies the WebSocket version.

2. Server Response: The server checks the headers and responds with a 101 switching protocols status, confirming the websocket upgrade.
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols

Key Takeaways:
1. WebSockets start as an http request: The client sends an HTTP GET request with upgrade:WebSocket header
2. The server upgrades the connection --> It responds with 101 switching protocols --> switching to websocket
3. After upgrade, websockets operate on single tcp connection --> Unlike http, no extra headers are needed.
4. Real time communication is possible --> Messages are send and received asynchronously without waiting for http responses.


What is OT: Operational Transformation ?
--> OT is a technique used in collaborative editing to handle concurrent edits. The goal is to ensure that multiple users
 can edit the document without conflicts.
